This repository provides easy scripts to run PrimeQA applications via docker.
<br>

[![LICENSE|Apache2.0](https://img.shields.io/github/license/saltstack/salt?color=blue)](https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0.txt)

<h3> ‚úÖ Prerequisites </h3>

We use [docker](https://www.docker.com/) and [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) to run our application. Make sure you have the most up-to-date version of those tools. 

‚ö†Ô∏è **Important**: Make sure your docker has read/write permissions in the existing directory and sub-directories.


<h3> üíª Hardware Requirements </h3>

OS: Ubuntu 20.04.4 LTS

Memory: 32GB (64GB - Recommended)

GPU: NVIDIA Corporation GV100GL [V100 PCIe 16GB]

NVIDIA Driver version: 470.141.03

Disk space: 50 GB is required for the docker, 25 GB of available free space is needed in the docker container storage

<h3> üß© Installation </h3>

1. Set the environment variable `PUBLIC_IP` to the ip address of the localhost. This host must be reachable from where you will be accessing via the browser. Otherwise, please use VNC to access the host.
If accessig the application via the browser locally,  `PUBLIC_IP` can be set to `localhost`.

    ```
    export PUBLIC_IP=<hostname>
    ```

2. Please ensure that the following three ports are free and available: `50051`, `50059` and `82`

3. Launch the container using `bash` in `cpu` (default) or `gpu` mode: 

    CPU mode (default):

    ```
    launch.sh
    ``` 

    GPU mode:

    ```
    launch.sh -m gpu
    ```

üö® **Note**: This process will take a while to complete as it will download necessary docker images and bring up services.


<h3>‚öôÔ∏è Configuration </h3>

1. Run `docker ps` to verify that all the three containers (primeqa-ui, primqa-orchestrator and primeqa-service) are running.

2. You will need to configure a few additional settings before first use. These setting are intentionally left blank for security purposes. 

3. Open your browser of choice (Mozilla Firefox/Google Chrome) and visit "http://`{PUBLIC_IP}`:50059/docs". This url shows the available orchestrator APIs.

4. Click on [PATCH] `/settings`. Once expanded, click on the `Try it out` button and copy-paste the Retriever and Reader settings that you would like to use from the examples below. 

    a. To use the IBM¬Æ Watson Discovery retriever and PrimeQA reader, first configure a IBM¬Æ Watson Discovery Cloud instance using the instructions [here](https://cloud.ibm.com/catalog/services/watson-discovery) and create a collection index.

    ```json
	{
        "retrievers": {
            "Watson Discovery": {
                "service_endpoint": "<IBM¬Æ Watson Discovery Cloud/CP4D Instance Endpoint>",
                "service_token": "<Bearer token (ONLY If using IBM¬Æ Watson Discovery CP4D Instance)>",
                "service_api_key": "<API key (ONLY If using IBM¬Æ Watson Discovery Cloud instance)>",
                "service_project_id": "<IBM¬Æ Watson Discovery Project ID>"
            },
        },
        "readers": {
            "PrimeQA": {
                "service_endpoint": "primeqa:50051",
                "beta": 0.7
            }
        }
    }
    ```
    
    b. To use the PrimeQA retriever and PrimeQA reader, first setup the collection index for the Retriever using the instructions [here](https://github.com/primeqa/primeqa/tree/main/primeqa/services#-store).

    ```json
	{
        "retrievers": {
            "PrimeQA": {
                "service_endpoint": "primeqa:50051",
            }
        },
        "readers": {
            "PrimeQA": {
                "service_endpoint": "primeqa:50051",
                "beta": 0.7
            }
        }
    }
    ```

    NOTE: The final scoring and ranking is done with a weighted sum of the Reader answer scores and Retriever search hits scores. The `beta` field is the weight assigned to the reader scores and `1-beta` is the weight assigned to the retriever scores.

5. Click the `Execute` button. You will see status code: 200 indicating success and updated settings when you scroll down.

6. Please allow 30 seconds for the primeqa-orchestrator to establish connectivity to IBM¬Æ Watson Discovery and PrimeQA service.

<h3> üß™ Testing </h3>

1. You can test the PrimeQA orchestrator's connectivity to your IBM¬Æ Watson Discovery (WD) instance by executing the [GET] `/retrievers/{retriever_id}/collections` endpoint.

    ```sh
    curl -X 'GET' "http://{$PUBLIC_IP}:50059/retrievers/WatsonDiscovery/collections" -H 'accept: application/json'
    ```

2. To see all available retrievers, execute [GET] `/retrievers` endpoint

    ```sh
    curl -X 'GET' "http://{$PUBLIC_IP}:50059/retrievers" -H 'accept: application/json'
    ```

3. To run a sample question answering query, execute [POST] `/ask` endpoint

    a. Using the IBM¬Æ Watson Discovery Retriever (You must provide the name of your <collection_id>)
    ```sh
    curl -X 'POST' "http://{$PUBLIC_IP}:50059/ask" -H 'accept: application/json' \
    -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    -d '{
    "question": "<SAMPLE QUERY>",
    "retriever": {
        "retriever_id": "WatsonDiscovery" 
    },
    "collection": {
        "collection_id": "<collection_id> from collections returned by [GET]/collections API.",
        "name": "Name of corresponding collection"
    },
    "reader": {
        "reader_id": "ExtractiveReader"
    }
    }'
    ```
    b. Using the PrimeQA Retriever (You must provide the name of your <collection_id>)

    ```sh
    curl -X 'POST' "http://{$PUBLIC_IP}:50059/ask" -H 'accept: application/json' \
    -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    -d '{
    "question": "<SAMPLE QUERY>",
    "retriever": {
        "retriever_id": "ColBERTRetriever"
    },
    "collection": {
        "collection_id": "<collection_id> from collections returned by [GET]/collections API.",
        "name": "Name of corresponding collection"
    },
    "reader": {
        "reader_id": "ExtractiveReader"
    }
    }'
    ```

4. To run reading:

    ```sh
    curl -X 'POST' \
    "http://{$PUBLIC_IP}:50059/GetAnswersRequest" \
    -H 'accept: application/json' \
    -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    -d '{
    "question": "Where was Genghis Khan buried?",
    "contexts": [
        "Before Genghis Khan died, he assigned √ñgedei Khan as his successor and split his empire into khanates among his sons and grandsons. He died in 1227 after defeating the Western Xia. He was buried in an unmarked grave somewhere in Mongolia at an unknown location.  His descendants extended the Mongol Empire across most of Eurasia by conquering or creating vassal states out of all of modern-day China, Korea, the Caucasus, Central Asia, and substantial portions of modern Eastern Europe, Russia, and Southwest Asia. Many of these invasions repeated the earlier large-scale slaughters of local populations. As a result, Genghis Khan and his empire have a fearsome reputation in local histories.."
    ],
    "reader": {
        "reader_id": "ExtractiveReader",
        "parameters": [
        {
            "parameter_id": "max_num_answers",
            "value": 5
        }
        ]
    }
    }'
    ```

    Example Answer:

    ```sh
    [
        {
            "text": "Mongolia at an unknown location",
            "confidence_score": 1,
            "start_char_offset": 229,
            "end_char_offset": 260,
            "context_index": 0
        }
    ]
    ```


<h2> ü•Å Usage </h2>

You can now open a browser of your choice (Mozilla Firefox/Google Chrome) and visit "http://{PUBLIC_IP}:82" to interact with the PrimeQA application. You will see our Retrieval, Reader and QuestionAnswering components.  Some features include the ability to adjust settings and for users to provide feedback on retrieved answers. 


<h2> üíª User Feedback </h2>

Users can provide feedback via the üëç and üëé icons to the answers shown in the results page. 

To use the feedback to fine-tune your Reader model

1. Get the feedback data:
  
  ```sh
    curl -X 'GET' \
  'http://localhost:50059/feedbacks?application=reading&application=qa&_format=primeqa' \
  -H 'accept: application/json' > feedbacks.json
  ```

2. Follow the instructions on how to finetune a PrimeQA reader with custom data [here](https://github.com/primeqa/primeqa/tree/main/examples/custom_mrc#finetuning-using-feedback-data). Generally, the finetuning would start with the model used when collecting the feedback data as specified in the `Model` field under `Reader` settings in the `Reading` and/or `QuestionAnswering` UI.

3. To deploy the finetuned model, follow the instructions [here](#custom-mrc).



<h2 id="troubleshooting"> ü§® Troubleshooting</h2>

a. If the UI is not loading properly or a field is blank, please try these quick steps:
   - clear the browser cache and retry
   - restart the containers by running `terminate.sh` and then `launch.sh`

b. To view the logs, use the docker logs command, for example:

    ```
    docker logs primeqa-ui
    docker logs primeqa-orchestrator
    docker logs primeqa-services
    ```

<h2> ü§® Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) </h2>

1. How do I switch to a different PrimeQA Reader model from the Huggingface model hub ?

    Paste the model name from the [Huggingface model hub](https://huggingface.co/PrimeQA) into the  `Model` field under `Reader` settings in the `Reading` and/or `QuestionAnswering` UI.

    IMPORTANT:  Only models trained using PrimeQA are supported.  Other models based on Huggingface QA model will not work.
 
2. <a id="custom-reader"></a>How do I use my custom model for reader in `Reading` or `QA` application?

    By default the reader initializes the `PrimeQA/nq_tydi_sq1-reader-xlmr_large-20221110` from the Huggingface model hub. 

    To use your own reader model, place your model in a directory under `primeqa-store/models` directory.  To point to your model from the UI, navigate to  `Application Settings`, scroll down to `Reader Settings` and to `Model` and set it to `/store/model/<model-dir>`, replace `model-dir` with the name of the directory containing the model files.

    The service will load the model and initialize a new reader.  This may take a few minutes. Subsequent queries will use this model.

3. How do I use my ColBERT index and checkpoint ? 

    Please follow the instructions [here](https://github.com/primeqa/primeqa/tree/main/primeqa/services#-store) 

4. The Corpus field is blank in the 'Retriever' or 'Question Answering' page
